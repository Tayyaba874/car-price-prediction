# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts the **selling price of used cars** using machine learning. It uses a **Linear Regression** model trained on real-world data, including vehicle specs like price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Car Price Prediction (Used Cars)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars)  
The dataset includes:
- `Selling_Price` (Target)
- `Present_Price`, `Driven_kms`, `Owner`, etc.
- Car names, fuel types, transmission types (one-hot encoded)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict used car prices using regression
- Visualize actual vs predicted values
- Practice end-to-end data science project workflow

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

---

## 🛠️ Workflow Summary

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Apply One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables
4. Train/Test split
5. Model training with **Linear Regression**
6. Evaluate with **R² Score**
7. Visualize predictions

---

## 📊 Output

- R² Score indicating model performance  
- Scatter plot of **Actual vs Predicted Car Prices**
